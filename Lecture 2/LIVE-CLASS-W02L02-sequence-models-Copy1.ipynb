Unfortunately the roller grabs threads and other long dirt items and wraps them around so tight the roller just stops working.  You have to either \"remember\" to unwind it each time or suffer like I did and get frustrated. After 3 weeks of trying to put up with it because the no-cord thing is fabulous, it stopped working - just plain old stopped - quit - nada - nothing.  It leaves tomorrow.'\n",

      " b\"HOOVER STEAMVAC CARPET CLEANER: I love this carpet cleaner. I use to own a rental property and when the tenants left I found out that they were letting the dogs poop all over the floor. My sister always wanted to get new carpet even though the carpet was already fairly new. I would use my trusty carpet cleaner and the carpets came just as clean as when we bought it. I love the surge this one has to offer. I have a great vacuum and thought I was getting all the dirt out of the carpet but the Hoover SteamVac showed me just how much dirt was still in the carpet. I've had it for about 7 years also cleaning my own carpet. Somehow I lost the tubing that went with the upholstery cleaner. Thinking I have abused this one enough even though it still worked great I bought another one. I'm going to give my first one to my sister since she has borrowed it a few times. I've heard about leaking and it has leaked a few times but I put it on the vinyl floor and there is very little water to wipe up. It was wet when I put it there from cleaning the carpet so I feel it is normal. I more than highly recommend the Hoover SteamVac. It works better than the Rug Doctor I use to rent.\"\n",
      " b'This worked great for about the first 15 minutes: This worked great for about the first 15 minutes, then all of a sudden the handle and water tank kept falling off during use, causing water to spill everywhere. I could not get it to stay together, seemed like a defective handle so I sent it back the same day I got it out of the box. Disappointing.'\n",
      " b'It appears Hoover made some minor but useful improvements over the last one we had: Had purchased a very similar Hoover model about 10 years ago, which finally needed to be replaced.  Used this one for the first time and it cleaned very well.  It appears Hoover made some minor but useful improvements over the last one we had.'\n",

      " b'Five Stars: Love it!  It cleans great'\n",
      " b\"Hoover pulled its own support of this product: I bought the Linx at Target two years ago at full price, it worked well until recently when the battery died. A full charge won't last more than 3m. And the battery replacement is as expensive as a new vacuum. To make it worse, you can no longer buy replacement filter from Hoover's website, and it is nowhere to be found on the internet. Note the filter is cheap (I believe it is the main reason Hoover stopped selling it), but it is the most important part of the vacuum, because it maintains air pressure, therefore suction power of the equipment, an improperly designed filter (which is the only thing you can find on website) can cause the vacuum to lose most of its suction - it is exactly what happened to my Linx, the difference is day and night.\\n\\nhttp://hoover.com/products/details/bh50010/platinum-collection-linx-cordless-stick-vacuum/\\n\\nTo be fair, the product itself worked like a charm, but I am very disappointed about Hoover's poor product support. If Hoover is so arrogant that it threw a product to the market and then turn a blind eye on its customer, it'd be the last thing I would ever buy from them.\"\n",
      " b\"Does the job: The return vent for the heater and A/C came apart in the attic.  It wasn't discovered for several months.\\n\\nThis Steam cleaner was part of the cleanup process and worked very well.\\n\\nIt does go through the water, which is actually good.\\n\\nChanging the water is not hard.  Just have to carry water back and forth from where you are working.\\n\\nRemember to go slow.  It has to have time to do the work.\"\n",
      " b\"Worth the money!: I received my rug cleaner from Amazon in two days as promised. I put it together in less than 2 minutes and headed down to clean my carpet. We had recently had the carpet cleaned by a professional. But we had also recently gotten a puppy. I a amazed at the amount of dirt this machine had cleaned up in a short amount of time.  I definitely lucked out with the deal if the day. I can't wait to try the attachments on the car seats. Hopefully it will do just as good of a job as it did on my carpet.\"\n",
      " b\"Good quality, great price: It works as well as any home carpet washer I've used.  We don't use it very often so I expect it to last many yers.\"\n",
      " b\"battery charger died after 2.5 yrs: I bought this vacuum 2 1/2 years ago.  The battery charger just died after seeing some electrical arcing.  It didn't last long enough imo.  The vacuum itself was not used heavily.  Worked fairly well.  Well enough to pick up cat litter.  The bin that held the dirt fell out sometimes.  It's possible I didn't get it snapped in well enough but I found it annoying.\"\n",
      " b'Got this yesterday and I am in love!! works so well: Got this yesterday and I am in love!! works so well! the suction is very strong and got everything along baseboards, under cabinets, corners! so convenient and love the cordless feature!!'\n",

      " b'Great carpet machine.: Great machine. So easy to use and to clean up after use.'\n",
      " b'Five Stars: Item very easy to use, works well.  I boiled the water before use, as per some reviews.'\n",
      " b\"Frustrated: I have had mine for a little over a year.  Worked well for about 9 months, I use if quite a bit. I have an older dog who has accidents a lot. Into the 10th month,I started having problems with the brushes not rotating.  We have sprayed WD-40 and completed the recommended maintenance. The brushes would work and then repeatedly quit rotating. I also started noticing leaks.  The seal around the dirty water tank is lose, just pulled it out for use again; same problems.  I am going to have to purchase another machine!  I can't see investing any more money by replacing the tank (around $50.) since I think the brush turbine is possibly rusted.  This model is one that is recommended highly and I did a lot of research before purchasing. I am just not sure what to buy next time.\"\n",
      " b\"which is probably why it has so many great reviews. However: I would have given this 5 stars in the first few months I had it, which is probably why it has so many great reviews. However, after using it for 7 months, it has completely stop sucking up anything. There's no blockage and the battery is fully charged and it turns on fine, just no suction. If you buy, don't expect it to be very useful for more than a year.\"\n",
      " b\"its not a cleaner by any stretch of the ...: its not a  cleaner by any stretch of the imagination.. and you get what you pay for.. the foot release is crappy and broke after 1 day of use.. was lucky it wasn't the power switch as I would have BEEN ELECTROCUTED!\"\n",
      " b\"At first, great. No longevity.: If you'd like a steamer that lasts more than a year, look elsewhere.\\n\\nI loved this thing for the first year. Then the brushes stopped spinning so I took the thing apart and found pieces that were rusted through. Cleaned what I could and put it back together. Still nothing. I guess that they really just don't make them like they used to. Now just a hunk of junk until I get it fixed or toss it.\"\n",
      " b\"hit or miss...ours was a miss!: i decided to order this specific carpet cleaner because it had lots of great reviews (some bad ones too but didn't pay too much attention) and a great price! one thing i learned from the reviews that it's either hit or miss kind of a thing. ours was totally broken. when we took it out of the box, it was an open package and looked used. my husband was skeptical and wanted to return at that point. but i just too excited! we read instructions and did everything right but it was broken. the bottom tank never collected the dirty water instead my bathroom floor got wet :((...return was easy and got my money back....not sure if i want to get the same one again though...\"\n",
      " b\"leaked water that soaked the carpet: Used 6 times and had to throw out. Worked great first 2 times, then started leaking water badly on the carpet so all carpets were soaked. We googled it, was a common problem and not easily solved. Husband took it apart to try and fix it and bits had all come apart inside it. We were too late to return it so were stuck with a carpet cleaner that couldn't be fixed, leaked constantly and was totally useless.\"\n",
      " b'Keep looking.: Sorry, but this vacuum was way overpriced, and lasted only about four months. During the first few months, I was so happy with it, I bought one for my daughter too.  We both loved it until it was just past being able to return it, then they both started jamming, hard to clean, stuff would get trapped up inside between the bottom and the canister.  Then, I noticed dirt shooting out behind me, it would suck up the dirt, then I would look behind me and there it was all over the floor.  Short battery life too.  My $40 Red Devil held up better and lasted longer than this one.'\n",
      " b'Five Stars: solid product. highly recommended'\n",
      " b\"Should have rented a rug doctor: I wish I would have saved my money and just rented a rug doctor. You have to heat the water before you put it in there. It doesn't get down IN the fibers of the carpet like I wanted. It especially doesn't work on longer fibers.\"\n",
      " b\"Buyer Beware~: Terrible!\\n\\nSuction was a continuous problem, the solution buttons stopped working after 3 months and the machine is very difficult to clean.\\n\\nDon't waste your time.\\n\\nI also tried another Bissell carpet cleaner (Model # ProHeat 2X Healthy Home Full Sized Carpet Cleaner, 66Q4)....JUST AS BAD!\"\n",
      " b'Five Stars: perfect item! works great and leaves my carpet very clean. No more pet allergies for my family'\n",
      " b'Works great and like the rinse cycle: This is replacement for an old model. Works great and like the rinse cycle. Never liked leaving the wash cycle still in carpet. Had a walk area  stain on light carpet and tho I had to wash several times-it is nearly gone. Think one more time will do it. A real improvement from old models.'\n",
      " b\"A good product: Although this thing is quite expensive, it does work very well. So you get what you pay for. My only complaints are that the duct collection cup is rather small for a vacuum that picks up so much stuff. And being an engineer, I like to hear things click into place.

I was quite happy and gave it 5 stars.\\n\\nI'm back today, giving it only 1 star because I used it, I HATE it!!! My hands are so sore I can barely type this. Here's the CONS:\\n\\nThe position of the cord is despicable. It is at the base, actually beneath it. No matter how you try to hang on to it, it continually falls to the floor. I kept tripping on it and it made using the shampooer more difficult. It's not very long either. I had to keep moving it to an appropriate outlet.\\n\\nThe button for dispensing the solution and the water is somewhat awkward, which is why my hands are so sore. I had a difficult time continually pressing it while handing on to the cord.\\n\\nThe unit is small. To clean a 11x 15 foot room, I had to fill and refill the reservoirs four times. That's ridiculous. I never had to do that with my Bissel. Granted my carpets were dirty, but it's still excessive work and excessive use of product.\\n\\nIt does use an extremely huge amount of solution. It took almost one bottle of solution for EACH OF FIVE ROOMS. That's too much. For all the work and the expense of the solution, I could have hired a professional carpet cleaner.\\n\\nI and so disappointed and I apologize, I will never write another review unless I use the product first. I'm happy to hear so many folks had good luck with this unit, but I had a terrible experience. I want my Bissel back.\\n\\nOh and PROS:  I don't have anything to recommend.\",\n",

It just wasn't put together very well. This cleaner is a breeze to disassemble and the separate water tanks are a serious bonus. The previous clean bladder inside the dirty water tank was awful and disgusting. Don't do that Bissell. That's gross. This one so far has worked perfectly, quickly and dries even faster than the Bissell that had the heated air blowing over the carpet just to help it dry. Do it.\",\n",

My husband and I have taken out every single screw that exists on the machine and it still will not open.

I would've given this vacuum by Hoover a better rating if their customer service was more timely as well as not selling me a product that broke after ~3 months of use.\",\n",
       "       b\"2nd unit down: I originally bought it in 2011.  Used it 3 times and the next time I tried to use it the attachment feature failed to work.  Instead of water going through the attachments it would leak all over the carpet.  Since it was more than 30 days from purchase I contacted hoover instead of amazon.  I was instructed to take it to a local vacuum repair shop.  I left it at the shop and two weeks was informed hoover just replaced the unit.  After getting the brand new replacement I've used it twice and it was fine, the third time the brushes failed to work at all.  Two units failed after very little use at all.  Terrible quality.\",\n",

What a waste of money..they do not stand behind their products...',\n",
       "       b\"Updated review after owning for 5 months. Waste of money!: We have wall-to-wall carpet and 8 pets. With that many animals in our house, having a washer is just as important as a vacuum. This was our 4th one we've purchased in the last 4 years, all different models/brands, and so far it seems like the best option for the price range (we paid $160). We haven't had it very long but if I experience any problems I'll update my review at that time.\\n\\nWe just cleaned all of our carpets and I am very impressed with the results! Both water receptacles are larger than others I've had, which is nice for multiple reasons: 1) You can do more before you have to refill/empty, 2) It helps to add some weight which pushed down on the front end, helping it suck up more dirty water. Because of that, our carpets were dry within an hour of cleaning. It has a long cord, the extensions for upholstery work well, the whole thing is just very easy to use. Our carpets are noticeably cleaner than they were when we cleaned with our previous shampooers.\\n\\n**UPDATE** It's junk. Don't waste your money!! It worked great for the first 4.5 months. But one day, it started doing something strange where it wasn't spraying the water correctly, it would just make 5 straight lines of water that you could see as you were cleaning. It obviously wasn't cleaning properly. We did some searching on google and discovered this is a common problem, the gears for the spinning brushes stop spinning due to rust, and the spinning of the brushes is what helps disperse the water into a mist across your carpet. So, we spent a couple hours watching youtube videos and carefully taking it apart to try to grease the gears to see if they would start moving again. They work briefly, and then the brushes totally stop moving again and you're back to no scrubbing and the lines of water.\\n\\nAdditionally, we tried to use the upholstery attachment for the SECOND time ever, and the water would no longer spray out of the attachment. I had to use a spray bottle and mist the couch manually to use it. We made sure it wasn't plugged or anything, but nope. Just didn't work anymore.\\n\\nWe only used this cleaner about once a month on fairly small areas. We live in a small apartment so there's only so much area to clean. Definitely not a good buy, we wasted our $160.\",\n",
       "       b'First time use....I love it: It\\'s brand new and did a fabulous job today.  The unit is not the most sturdy feeling, it seems like most everything is being made of \"plastic\".  I will keep this in mind when using it and try to avoid any rough handling.\\n\\nI was just a little concerned when assembling the unit because I did not hear the \"snap\" sound.  Before using it for the first time I kept an old towel handy in case of leaking, but happily everything was fine.  By the way, assembling was quick and easy.\\n\\nWith over 3,000 reviews, I can understand why this seems to be a popular machine for many years.\\nI hope to have continued success with it, will update later if any trouble is noticed.',\n",
